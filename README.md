Phaser3 Game running on node.js

I enjoy coding and solving problems. This is an ongoing project that lets me do that. This also means that functionality gets priority over form but I plan to make it look pretty eventually.

The plan is to have a civilisation that plans and manages itself. Baby steps though.

Problems solved:
- Players can find jobs
- Players can have properties
- Can construct buildings
- Custom pathing around buildings

To get started:
    cd to directory
    npm install
    node app.js
